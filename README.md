This is a semester project participating in the "Digital Marketplace" class for the MSc in Design and Digital Media (2009-2010) at the University of Edinburgh.

I worked on a Commercial evaluation study, a Business plan, an executive summary and slide presentation for a web system that I created specifically for this project, named "Rapidportfolio.com".

Rapidportfolio.com is an online tool that helps the users to build a print friendly image-based portfolio of their selected work, very fast and elegantly.
